# Index of SimpleX Groups and Communitiies

Open to ideas on this whole idea. This list currently just includes some server, which are the current unambiguously known "public" groups or an individually shared private groups.

Also, this is a honeypot for spam and particularly without moderation, which simplex is not designed for, this index and room discovery in general are pointless and, if anything at all, undermine or even harm the concept that SimpleX aims to providr. 

Finally, plans are to move this repository to Codeberg and maintain it by using only tor connections for greater anonymity
