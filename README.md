# Index of Public SimpleX Groups/Communitiies

Open to ideas on this whole idea. This list currently just includes some server, which are the current unambiguously known "public" groups or an individually shared private groups.

Also, this is a honeypot for spam and particularly without moderation, which simplex is not designed for, this index and room discovery in general are pointless and, if anything at all, undermine or even harm the concept that SimpleX aims to providr.
